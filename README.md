Now you can use the shortcode [events_list] in any post or page to display the events list. The shortcode accepts the following optional parameters:

limit - Number of events to display (default: -1, shows all events)
past - Whether to show past events (default: false)
Examples:

[events_list] - Shows all upcoming events
[events_list limit="5"] - Shows the next 5 upcoming events
[events_list past="true"] - Shows all events, including past events
[events_list limit="10" past="true"] - Shows the last 10 events, including past events
