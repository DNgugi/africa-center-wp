# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WordPress theme's desktop dropdown navigation menu is currently constrained within the header's height boundaries, causing dropdown items to appear in a scrolling window instead of extending naturally outside the header. This creates a poor user experience where users cannot properly access dropdown menu items. The mobile/tablet implementation works correctly by rendering dropdown items outside the header bounds, but the desktop version needs to be fixed to match this behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor using a desktop browser, I want dropdown navigation menus to extend outside the header boundaries, so that I can easily access all menu items without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a navigation item with children on desktop THEN the dropdown menu SHALL appear outside and below the header container
2. WHEN the dropdown menu is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT be constrained by the header's height or overflow properties
3. WHEN the dropdown menu appears THEN it SHALL maintain proper z-index stacking to appear above all other page content
4. WHEN the dropdown menu extends beyond the viewport THEN it SHALL use smart positioning to remain visible (as currently implemented)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the dropdown menu styling and functionality to remain consistent, so that the visual design and interactions work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dropdown overflow fix is applied THEN all existing dropdown styling SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN hovering over dropdown items THEN the hover effects and transitions SHALL continue to work as before
3. WHEN the dropdown menu appears THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual appearance as the current implementation
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the dropdown accessibility features SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor using mobile or tablet devices, I want the mobile dropdown functionality to remain unchanged, so that my mobile experience is not affected by the desktop fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the site on mobile devices THEN the mobile dropdown menu behavior SHALL remain exactly as it currently works
2. WHEN the desktop fix is applied THEN mobile/tablet breakpoints SHALL not be affected
3. WHEN switching between desktop and mobile views THEN both dropdown implementations SHALL work independently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fix to be maintainable and not interfere with existing header functionality, so that future updates don't break the navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dropdown overflow fix is implemented THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with header scroll animations
2. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the two-line layout functionality SHALL continue to work properly
3. WHEN the dropdown menu is active THEN it SHALL NOT affect the header's fixed positioning or other header elements
4. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL use CSS-only solutions without requiring JavaScript changes
